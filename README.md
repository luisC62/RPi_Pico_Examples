# Example progams for RPi Pico in MicroPython

This is a collection of example programs written in Python for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.
The initial list of programs is the following:
* blink_001.py (A Led blinking)
* button_001.py (Testing a button)
* button_interrupt_001.py (Making software interrups via hardware buttons)
* i2c_scanner_001.py (find i2c devices)
* state_machine_001.py (Programming a state machine)
* oled_text_001.py (Test sending test to the i2c oled display)
* oled_img_001.py (Test sending an image to the i2c oled display)
* oled_img_002.py (Test sending an image to the i2c oled display using a state machine)


## Tech

Following techologies are used:

* [Raspberry Pi pico]: The Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller
* [SSD 1306]: OLED Display with i2c communication capabilities
* [MicroPython]: Adapted Python language for small devices.
* [Thonny]: Environment for Micropython programming
* [I2C] : Field / PCB communication protocol between components


## Prerequisites

Just Thonny environment should be enough 

## Installing


## Running the example programs

To run the application do the following:
1. Run Thonny and load the programs to the microcontroller
2. Select a program an run pressing the run button
